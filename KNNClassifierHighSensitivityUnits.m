%% IDENTIFY HIGHLY SENSITIVE UNITS
% load unit activity and lingual-palatal contact(lpc)
% load or run spike calculations for each window of set duration
% create 2-D matrix of variation for each unit and trial
    % this will be a hint as to which units are the most sensitive
% run cross correlation between binary contact and spikes/window to check
% for lag
% Do the same for graded gape cycle and spikes/window
% Take correlation(0-1) for each unit for each trial and run basic stats to
% identify most sensitive and how much more sensitive
